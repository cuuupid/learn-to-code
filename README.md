## Confused? Ask a question

I'm very active on GitHub and will try to answer any issues right away. Please **don't** email me for help. There is an "Issues" tab on the top; if you create an issue and, from the right hand side of the issue editor, click the gear icon next to labels, you can add the "Question" label to your issue.

## Prerequisites

For anything you'll need a [nice editor](http://code.visualstudio.com) and a terminal ([here's a better one](http://hyper.is)). (If you're completely new to this, follow [these instructions](/bash) to open terminal).

## Getting Bash

Please use bash and go through the `bash` tutorial first.
- Test your installation: open a bash terminal, in the `bash` folder `bash helloworld.sh`

## Some helpful tools we'll use

**For Windows**, upgrade to Windows 10 and [enable WSL](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/commandline/wsl/install-win10).
**For Mac**, install [Homebrew](http://brew.sh).

You'll also need git.
**For Windows** install [Git](https://git-scm.com/download/win).
**For Mac** use homebrew to install, `brew install git` from Terminal.

## Requirements for Languages

For `python` you'll need [Python 3.6](https://www.anaconda.com/download/) and jupyter notebook (comes with anaconda).
- Test your installation: in the `python` https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/installation/#mongodb-community-editionfolder, `python helloworld.py`

For `js` you'll need a web browser, [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/), React (`npm install create-react-app`), and [MongoDB](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/installation/#mongodb-community-edition) (you also have to run `npm install -g mongoose`).
- Test your installation: in the `js` folder, `python helloworld.js`
