# Learn to Code

A repo for teaching materials on some languages.

This is a **Github Repo** and you can navigate to different folders from the explorer pane above.

For anything you'll need a [nice editor](http://code.visualstudio.com) and a terminal ([here's a better one](http://hyper.is)). (If you're completely new to this, follow [these instructions](../../bash/) to open terminal).

**For Windows**, upgrade to Windows 10 and [enable WSL](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/commandline/wsl/install-win10).
**For Mac**, install [Homebrew](http://brew.sh).

You'll also need git.
**For Windows** install [Git](https://git-scm.com/download/win).
**For Mac** use homebrew to install, `brew install git` from Terminal.

Please use bash and go through the `bash` tutorial first.
- Test your installation: open a bash terminal, in the `bash` folder `bash helloworld.sh`

For `python` you'll need [Python 3.6](https://www.anaconda.com/download/) and jupyter notebook (comes with anaconda).
- Test your installation: in the `python` https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/installation/#mongodb-community-editionfolder, `python helloworld.py`

For `js` you'll need a web browser, [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/), React (`npm install create-react-app`), and [MongoDB](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/installation/#mongodb-community-edition) (you also have to run `npm install -g mongoose`).
- Test your installation: in the `js` folder, `python helloworld.js`
